# SMT/SAT Encoder for Exact Solving of the RCPSP/t
Encodes a problem instance into the [SMT2 language](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml) or CNF (DIMACS format),
for an exact solving approach for the RCPSP/t (Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Time-Dependent Resource Capacities and Requests) using SAT solvers.

## Test Data
Test instances that can be parsed by this implementation can be downloaded from http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/newinstances.html.
These instances were generated by S. Hartmann (2013) (see [references](#References) below).
