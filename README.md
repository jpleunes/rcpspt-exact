# SMT/SAT Encoder for Exact Solving of the RCPSP/t
TODO: update
Encodes a problem instance into the [SMT2 language](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml) using the C API provided by Yices 2, or into CNF (DIMACS format).
This facilitates exact solving of the RCPSP/t (Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Time-Dependent Resource Capacities and Requests) using SAT solvers.

## Test Data
Test instances that can be parsed by this implementation can be downloaded from http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/newinstances.html.
These instances were generated by S. Hartmann (2013) (see [references](#References) below).

## Building
The following are prerequisites:
- An installation of the Yices 2 SMT solver: can be installed by following "Quick Installation" from https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2. 
Another option is to use Apt, as explained on the GitHub page.
The Makefile and CMakeLists.txt of this project expect that the Yices library is installed in the default location `/usr/local/`.
- The GMP library version 4.1 or newer (this was already required for Yices).
- For using the Makefile: g++ supporting the C++17 standard.

Building can be done by running `make` (clean with `make clean`), or by using CMake.
